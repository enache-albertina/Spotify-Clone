## Q&A Section

Q1: What is the primary purpose of this application?
A: This application is designed to simulate a music streaming service similar to Spotify. It features a range of functionalities that mimic user interactions, including actions specific to artists and hosts.

Q2: How does the application handle different user roles?
A: The application includes different types of users like normal users, artists, and hosts. Each user type has specific commands and functionalities. For example, artists can add albums, while hosts can add podcasts.

Q3: Can you explain the 'Page System' in this application?
A: The application features a Page System that simulates a graphical interface. Users can navigate between various pages like HomePage, LikedContentPage (for normal users), ArtistPage (for artists), and HostPage (for hosts), each offering different functionalities.

Q4: How are new features from Stage I integrated into Stage II?
A: All functionalities and commands implemented in Stage I remain valid in Stage II. Stage II extends these functionalities, incorporating new features and user types.

Q5: What functionalities are available on the Artist and Host pages?
A: On the ArtistPage, artists can manage their albums, merchandise, and events. The HostPage allows hosts to manage their podcasts and announcements.

##  Modular Architecture

* Singleton Pattern üôé‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
UserSingleton: This class ensures that there is only one instance of UserSingleton throughout the application. It holds a list of users and provides methods to interact with this list.

üòÑ Key Elements:
Private Constructor: The constructor is private, preventing instantiation from other classes.

üòÑ Static Instance: The instance variable holds the single instance of the class. It is initialized to null and is created upon the first call to getInstance().

üòÑ getInstance Method: This static method creates the UserSingleton instance if it doesn't exist and returns it.

*Visitor Pattern üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

üòÑ PageVisitor Interface: This interface defines visit methods for different types of pages (like HomePage, LikedContentPage, ArtistPage, HostPage).

üòÑ Key Elements:
Visitor Interface: The PageVisitor interface defines a visit method for each type of page. Each method takes a different type of page as its parameter.

üòÑ Accept Method in Pages: Each page class would have an accept method that takes a PageVisitor and calls the visit method corresponding to its class.

üòÑ The Visitor pattern allows you to add new operations to existing class hierarchies without changing the classes. It's particularly useful when dealing with a collection of different objects with distinct and evolving functionalities.
